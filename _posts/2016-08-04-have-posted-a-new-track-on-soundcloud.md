Have posted a new track on Soundcloud 

https://soundcloud.com/craig-farr/after-dusk-before-dawn

ItÂ´s actually part spokenword, a poem I wrote a long, long time ago, and some dark and moody electronica utilising some analog gear - Microbrute synth, Electribe drum machine, Korg Kaoss Pad and Roland DC-20 Analog Echo.
